FRBS Suite: A Collection of Type‑1 Fuzzy Rule‑Based System Applications Introduction Fuzzy rule‑based systems (FRBS) provide an interpretable framework for modeling complex, nonlinear relationships using human‑readable “if–then” rules. This monorepo brings together three end‑to‑end Takagi–Sugeno Type‑1 FRBS projects, each addressing a distinct prediction challenge:

Function approximation of an unknown nonlinear mapping Workability and strength prediction of concrete Heating and cooling load estimation for residential buildings Each project is self‑contained with its own data, source code, results and detailed instructions.

Projects Overview Project 1: Function Approximation Approximate an unknown single‑input, single‑output function

Why it matters: Function approximation is a fundamental testbed for any regression model. Here, a fuzzy‑rule approach demonstrates how a small set of human‑interpretable rules can capture an arbitrary nonlinear mapping. Key steps:

Load training (x_train, y_train) and test (x_test, y_test) data from function1.txt :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}. Define Gaussian fuzzy sets covering the input range. Formulate Takagi–Sugeno rules (each rule’s consequent is a linear function). Optimize membership σ parameters to minimize training error. Evaluate on test data (report RMSE) and plot true vs. approximated function over ([-2,2]) in 0.05 increments. Project 2: Concrete Properties Prediction Predict fresh‑ and hardened‑state properties of concrete—slump, flow and 28‑day compressive strength—based on mixture proportions. Why it matters: Concrete rheology and strength depend on multiple interacting components. A fuzzy‑rule model offers interpretability (e.g., “if water is high and cement is low, then slump increases”) alongside competitive accuracy. Key steps:

Load 103 mix designs (concrete_properties.csv) with 7 inputs and 3 outputs :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}. Preprocess: remove missing entries, normalize each feature. Use clustering (e.g., K‑Means) to define fuzzy regions in the 7‑D input space. Build one Takagi–Sugeno rule per cluster; fit a local linear model as each rule’s consequent. Tune Gaussian spreads to minimize cross‑validated RMSE on slump, flow and strength. Report mean & best RMSE on a 20% hold‑out set and provide per‑rule error breakdown. Project 3: Building Energy Load Estimation (Optional Bonus) Estimate heating load (HL) and cooling load (CL) requirements for residential buildings from eight design parameters. Why it matters: Accurate HL/CL prediction guides HVAC sizing and improves energy efficiency. A fuzzy‑rule system captures interactions—e.g., “if glazing area is high and orientation is south, cooling load jumps.” Key steps:

Read energy_efficiency.csv with 8 inputs (Relative Compactness, Surface Area, … Glazing Area Distribution) and 2 outputs (y1 = HL, y2 = CL) :contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}. Encode categorical inputs, normalize all features. Generate fuzzy partitions via grid or fuzzy C‑means clustering. Formulate Takagi–Sugeno rules and implement inference by weighted averaging. Optimize σ parameters (and linear consequents) to minimize train RMSE. Evaluate over multiple random 80/20 splits; report mean & best RMSE for both loads. Common Workflow Data Preparation Load raw data, handle missing values, encode categories, normalize features. Fuzzy Model Construction Define Gaussian membership functions (manually or via clustering). Formulate Takagi–Sugeno “if–then” rules linking antecedents to linear consequents. Inference & Aggregation Compute rule activations, aggregate weighted consequents for final prediction. Parameter Optimization Use optimizers (e.g., L‑BFGS‑B, TNC) to tune membership spreads (σ) and any linear coefficients. Evaluation Compute RMSE on held‑out test data. Generate comparison plots (where applicable). Save summaries (RMSE values, per‑rule analyses, plots) in each project’s results/ folder. 🤝 Contributing & Extensions We welcome improvements:
